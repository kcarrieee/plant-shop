  "description": "Long, lean and lovely are only a few appropriate adjectives that describe the immense beauty of Alocasia Dragon's Breath.

  "title": "Sterling Silver Scindapsus",
  "description":"Shimmery, satin, silvery love best describes this hunk of a houseplant! Sterling Silver Scindapsus (some call it Sterling Silver Pothos) sends a little chill down your spine with its luxurious leaves. Broad strokes of silver dominate the leaf's surface, while the central emerald green stripe emphasizes the contrasting tones. There is a lot to love about this indoor vine; low maintenance topping the list! Water Sterling Silver Scindapsus when the soil becomes dry, and ensure that it gets at least 4 hours of bright indirect light each day. This pothos can live in low, even light but will grow faster and retain more silver in their leaves when exposed to more extended periods of indirect sunlight.",

  "description": "There is no keeping this climber down! The Shingle Plant is hardwired to reach lofty heights, and it can attain its goal when given support (both physically and emotionally). Rhaphidophora hayi is an unusual plant in the way it grows. Roots form along the stems of the plant and attach themselves to surrounding surfaces, and as a result, the leaves appear as though they are magically suction-cupped on! Shingle Plants require above-average humidity and frequent watering to keep the soil moist (but not soggy). Another essential requirement is light: this indoor climbing plant benefits from bright indirect light for healthy leaf development.",
